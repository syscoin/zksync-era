  # L3 chains settling on gateway should balance overhead between compute and pubdata
  # since gateway storage is much cheaper than L1 blobs/calldata
  compute_overhead_part: 0.5  # Gateway has computational costs for processing L3 batches
  pubdata_overhead_part: 0.5  # Gateway storage is cheap but not free
  # These values reflect gateway's cost structure, not L1's cost structure
  # Can safely use higher limit within circuit constraints
